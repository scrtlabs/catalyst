Live Trading
============
This document explains how to get started with live trading.

Supported Exchanges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since version 0.4, Catalyst integrated with `CCXT <https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt>`_,
a cryptocurrency trading library with support for more than 90 exchanges. The 
range of CCXT and Catalyst support for each of those exchanges varies greatly. 
The most supported exchanges are as follows:

The exchanges available for backtesting are fully supported in live mode:

- Bitfinex, id = ``bitfinex``
- Bittrex, id = ``bittrex``
- Poloniex, id = ``poloniex``

Additionally, we have successfully tested in live mode the following exchanges :

- Binance, id = ``binance``
- GDAX, id = ``gdax``

As Catalyst is currently in Alpha and in under active development, you are 
encouraged to thoroughly test any exchange in *paper trading* mode before trading
*live* with it.

Paper Trading vs Live Trading modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Catalyst currently supports three different modes in which you can execute your
trading algorithm. The first is **backtesting**, which is covered extensively in
the tutorial, and uses historical data to run your algorithm. There is no 
interaction with the exchange in backtesting mode, and this is the first mode 
that you should test any new algorithm.

Once you are confident with the simulations that you have obtained with your
algorithm in backtesting, you may switch to live trading, where you have two
different modes:

* **Paper Trading**: The simulated algorithm runs in real time, and fetches 
  pricing data in real time from the exchange, but the orders never reach the 
  exchange, and are instead kept within Catalyst and simulated. No real currency
  is bought or sold. Think of it as a `backtesting happening in real time`.

* **Live Trading**: This is the proper live trading mode in which an algorithm
  runs in real time, fetching pricing data from live exchanges and placing 
  orders against the exchange. Real currency is transacted on the exchange 
  driven by the algorithm.

These three modes are controlled by the following variables:

+---------------+-------------------------+
|    Mode       |       Parameters        |
+               +-------+-----------------+
|               | live  | simulate_orders |
+---------------+-------+-----------------+
| backtesting   | False | True (default)  |
+---------------+-------+-----------------+
| paper trading | True  | True            |
+---------------+-------+-----------------+
| live trading  | True  | False           |
+---------------+-------+-----------------+


Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Most exchanges require token key/secret combination for authentication. By
convention, Catalyst uses an ``auth.json`` file to hold this data.

This example illustrates the convention using the *Bitfinex* exchange.
Here is how to generate key and secret values for the Bitfinex exchange:
https://docs.bitfinex.com/v1/docs/api-access. Most exchanges follow
a similar process.

The auth.json file:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "name": "bitfinex",
    "key": "my-key",
    "secret": "my-secret"
  }


The file goes here: ``~/.catalyst/data/exchanges/bitfinex/auth.json``

Note that the `bitfinex` part in the directory above corresponds to the id of the Bitfinex
exchange as defined in the "Supported Exchanges" section above.
Attempting to run an algorithm where the targeted exchange is missing
its ``auth.json`` file will create the directory structure and create an empty
auth.json file, but will result in an error.

Currency Symbols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Catalyst introduces a universal convention to reference
trading pairs and individual currencies. This
is required to ensure that the ``symbol()`` api predictably
returns the correct asset regardless of the targeted exchange.

Exchanges tend to use their own convention to represent currencies
(e.g. XBT and BTC both represent Bitcoin on different exchanges).
Trading pairs are also inconsistent. For example, Bitfinex
puts the base currency before the quote currency without a
separator, Bittrex puts the quote currency first and uses a dash
seperator.

Here is the Catalyst convention:

*[Base Currency]_[Quote Currency]* all lowercase.

Currency symbols (e.g. btc, eth, ltc) follow the Bittrex convention.

Here are some examples:

.. code:: python

  # With Bitfinex
  bitcoin_usd_asset = symbol('btc_usd')
  ethereum_bitcoin_asset = symbol('eth_btc')

  # With Bittrex
  ethereum_bitcoin_asset = symbol('eth_btc')
  neo_ethereum_asset = symbol('neo_eth)

Note that the trading pairs are always referenced in the same manner.
However, not all trading pairs are available on all exchanges. An
error will occur if the specified trading pair is not trading
on the exchange. To check which currency pairs are available on each 
of the supported exchanges, see 
`Catalyst Market Coverage <https://www.enigma.co/catalyst/status>`_.

Trading an Algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is no special convention to follow when writing an
algorithm for live trading. The same algorithm should work in
backtest and live execution mode without modification.

What differs are the arguments provided to the catalyst client or
`run_algorithm()` interface. Here is the same example in both interfaces:

.. code-block:: bash

  catalyst live -f my_algo_code -x bitfinex -c btc -n my_algo_name 

.. code-block:: python

  run_algorithm(
      initialize=initialize,
      handle_data=handle_data,
      analyze=analyze,
      exchange_name='bitfinex',
      live=True,
      algo_namespace='my_algo_name',
      quote_currency='btc'
  )


Here is the breakdown of the new arguments:

- ``live``: Boolean flag which enables live trading. It defaults to ``False``.
- ``capital_base``: The amount of quote_currency assigned to the strategy.
  It has to be lower or equal to the amount of quote currency available for
  trading on the exchange. For illustration, order_target_percent(asset, 1)
  will order the capital_base amount specified here of the specified asset.
- ``exchange_name``: The name of the targeted exchange. See the 
  `CCXT Supported Exchanges <https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Exchange-Markets>`_ 
  for the full list.
- ``algo_namespace``: A arbitrary label assigned to your algorithm for
  data storage purposes.
- ``quote_currency``: The quote currency used to calculate the
  statistics of your algorithm. Currently, the quote currency of all
  trading pairs of your algorithm must match this value.
- ``simulate_orders``: Enables the paper trading mode, in which orders are
  simulated in Catalyst instead of processed on the exchange. It defaults to 
  ``True``.
- ``end_date``: When setting the end_date to a time in the **future**,
  it will schedule the live algo to finish gracefully at the specified date.
- ``start_date``:
  The live algo starts by default in the present, as mentioned above.
  by setting the start_date to a time in the future, the algorithm would
  essentially sleep and when the predefined time comes, it would start executing.

In live trading the ``handle_data()`` function is called once every minute.

Here is a complete algorithm for reference:
`Buy Low and Sell High <https://github.com/enigmampc/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/examples/buy_low_sell_high.py>`_


Algorithm State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In live mode, each call to ``handle data`` saves the state of the algorithm.
Any information added to the ``context.state`` dictionary will be saved between runs.
During algorithm restart, the state is restored (if exists) in the initialization function.

Cleaning the state can be achieved by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    catalyst clean-algo -n my-algo-namespace



The `catalyst live` command offers additional parameters.
You can learn more by running the following from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    catalyst live --help



Commissions
^^^^^^^^^^^

In live mode, commissions are taken off according to what is reduced on the
exchange. In some exchanges, the fee is always
reduced from the quote currency where others reduce it from the currency
that was bought. Meaning that when buying ``btc`` using the ``btc_usd`` trading
pair, some exchanges will reduce the fee from the ``usd`` value,
while others will reduce it from the ``btc`` value, which will result in a
lower ``btc`` amount than the one originally specified.
In live Catalyst supports both methods, since the fees are fetched directly
from the exchanges.
Currently, in paper trading and backtest modes the commissions are reduced
**always** from the quote currency defined on the algorithm (we will align
these modes in the future with live mode).
